# Super-Mario-RL

**GOAL**: We will try to replicate the success of using Reinforcement Learning for Super Mario Bros and understand basic RL concepts over the span of 4-5 weeks . We will be following this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gmQZToTMac&t=1310s&ab_channel=SourishKundu). This project is purely for educational purposes and code belongs to the original owner. The code was dissected and rewritten in order to understand the workings of RL.

## Installation

**First, create a virtual environment**

You can use whatever Python version works for you. 

```bash
conda create --name <name of env> python=3.10.12 
```

Then, activate the environment.

```bash
conda activate <name of env>
```

**Then, install PyTorch v2.2.1**

Follow the instructions on [PyTorch's website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Using pip, the command is:

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

**Finally, install the rest of the requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
